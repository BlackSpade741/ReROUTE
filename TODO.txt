Features

# Train (implements Coordinate)
Fields
- Coordinates of trains
- Number of trains and their identities
- Route (which route the train is on)
- capacity/passenger count

Methods
- Speed, acceleration, distance to stop, brake acceleration based on passenger count
  - calculated using physical equations


# Station (implements Coordinate)
Fields
- Number of stations and their identities

Methods
- Stop time @ station based on inflow and outflow
- inflow/outflow (number of people getting on and getting off at said station)


# Route
Fields
- holds objects of trains and stations and manages them
- coordinates of route itself

Methods
- using math to use coordinates as measurements to do distance calculations
- 2D, beginning with straight line route to start off and expand upon
- get - distanceTraveled, time, ETA, schedule, distanceToStation


# Person (implements Coordinate)
Fields
- stations boarded & alighted
- name (for fun)
- id

Methods
- distance travelled


# Coordinate (interface)
Fields
- x & y coordinates

Methods
- calculate distance from one coordinate to aother


# GUI 
- animated representation of trains and the ATC model
- accelerated time for longer period shown
- using JFrame and Swing
- sprites of train (scaled down but same dimensions) & passenger (same ratio)
