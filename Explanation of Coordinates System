The coordinate system we are using is rather unconventional in that it is one dimensional.

We made this decision for a few reasons:

i) Trains follow a single path so we only need a one dimensional value to store any trains location
ii) Extra data only complicates calculations etc. while adding very little in terms of actual benefits (for our purposes)
ii) Having a single value rather than a 2d vector makes locating trains on the track simpler
iv) Potential off track errors where the horizontal location of a train is incorrect are avoided

So what does this system look like for Toronto's Line 1 Subway?

Since this line is 30.2 km long we define all locations l as being in the range -30200 <= l < 30200.
Note we use 30200 (the meters) for improved granularity needed to accurately simulate train movements.
